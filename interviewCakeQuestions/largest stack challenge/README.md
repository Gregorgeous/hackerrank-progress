# Challenge description:

**You want to be able to access the largest element in a stack.**
(The _Stack_ class has already been implemented for you:)

Use your Stack class to implement a new class MaxStack with a method get_max() that returns the largest element in the stack. get_max() should not remove the item.
Your stacks will contain only integers.
