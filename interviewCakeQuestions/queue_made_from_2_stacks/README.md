# Challenge description:

**Implement a queue with 2 stacks. Your queue should have an enqueue and a dequeue method and it should be "first in first out" (FIFO).**

Optimize for the time cost of mm calls on your queue. These can be any mix of enqueue and dequeue calls.

Assume you already have a stack implementation and it gives O(1) time push and pop.
